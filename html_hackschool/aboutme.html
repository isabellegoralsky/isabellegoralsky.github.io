        <h2 id="describe">Hi! I'm <strong>Isabelle</strong>.</h2>
        <p id="intro">I am a first-year LA native at the University of California, Los Angeles (Go Bruins!). I intend to receive a BS in Computer Science.
        I am exceptionally passionate about design, particularly graphic and UI/UX applications. 
        From a young age, I have used creativity as an outlet to relieve my stress and allow 
        my brain to work freely! From nail art to web design, I have tried it all.  On top of my artistic interests, 
        I am also a huge advocate for living an active lifestyle. I become instantly more productive from the adrenaline that I get from activities such as hiking or 
        running with my dogs. My passion for innovation and creation drives me to my goal of creating a successful 
        career in software that will allow me to constantly explore and employ all of my interests. <img style="padding-left: 150px; padding-right:90px;" src="back.png"></p>
